# protots

protots "compiles" GRPC-based REST endpoints files.

## Setup

protots is currently made up of two sections:

### generator  

The `generator` is the tool that "compiles" the proto to the functions to be used. 

### base

The base is an npm package that is used to support the proto functions. 

## Sample

A sample set of protobuf files have been included in the `idl` folder. The Typescript equivalents can be generated by using the following command:

```bash
protots genfolder sample/
```

This will generate the files and place them into a `gen/` folder.


### TODO 

* Add maps
