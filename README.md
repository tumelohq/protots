# protots

protots "compiles" GRPC-based REST endpoints files.

## Pronunciation

Like tater tots, but pro-tots.

## Sample

A sample set of protobuf files have been included in the `idl` folder. The Typescript equivalents can be generated by using the following command:

```bash
protots genfolder sample/
```

This will generate the files and place them into a `gen/` folder.
